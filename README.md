# Intermediate Programming Projects

Getting better at programming is about giving yourself constraints and challenges.

Challenging constraints.

We can look at how masters in other fields get better, musicians, artists. What do they do?

One they practice a lot, but random playing isn't enough, it has to be challenging, it has to push you. We need Deliberate Practice.
