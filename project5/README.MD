# Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

Reverse Polish Notation Calculator is a notion where the operanands are followed by the operator.

5 2 +

6 2 * 3 +

This notion removes the need for parenthis and operator order is fixed from left to right, so you do not have to worry about precendence.

It is also a good project that makes use of a stack. Stacks are a super useful data structure to know and understand when to use it.



# Part 1

With these types of projects it is helpful at the being to come up with some test cases.

Think about what the edge cases could be and try to create several expressions that would be good tests of the algorithm.

# Part 2

Write a main function that takes an RPN expression as a string and returns a numeric result.

# Part 3

Validate that the function works properly against all test cases.
